# Social Media Intern

## Goals

The goal of this project is to have an api that can handle image data being sent from a client in JSON, and create a post on a configured social media site, with different templates based on trigger words in the image `subject`.

For example, a post with the word `practice` in the `subject` should use the `Practice` template, which says something like "Look at this photo from {{practiceDay}}'s practice!".
